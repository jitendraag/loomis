I decided to build Loomis as I read the highly popular text book Digital Image Processing. This is designed to be a simple Golang implementation of algorithms mentioned in the book. While I will do the simple implementations, I will also attempt to make a concurrent version of these algorithms.

Running:
$go run test.go histogram.go intensity_levels.go
